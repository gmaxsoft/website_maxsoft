    "softtxt3": "Programming Language",
    "softtxt4": "A scripting programming language designed to generate web pages and build real-time web applications. PHP is most often used for server-side web scripting, but it can also be used for command-line data processing. The implementation of PHP together with the Apache web server and the MySQL database server is referred to as the AMP platform.",
    "softtxt5": "Javascript Library",
    "softtxt6": "A JavaScript programming language library used to create graphical user interfaces for web applications. It was created by Jordan Walke, a Facebook programmer, and inspired by the PHP language extension - XHP. One of the main distinguishing features of the React.js library is the virtual DOM. React stores the entire application DOM in memory.",
    "softtxt7": "A scripting and multi-paradigm programming language, created by Netscape, most commonly used on websites. These scripts are most often used to provide interaction by responding to events, validating data entered in forms, or creating complex visual effects. JavaScript scripts run by websites have significantly limited access to the user's computer. On the server side, JavaScript can run as Node.js.",
    "softtxt8": "Markup Language",
    "softtxt9": "A markup language used to create and present web pages. It is an evolution of the HTML 4 language and its XML variant (XHTML 1), developed as part of the work of the WHATWG (Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group) and W3C.",
    "softtxt10": "Javascript Environment",
    "softtxt11": "An open-source, cross-platform runtime environment for developing server-side applications written in the JavaScript language. It contributed to the creation of the \"JavaScript everywhere\" paradigm, enabling developers to build applications within a single programming language instead of relying on separate server-side languages.",
    "softtxt12": "Open Framework",
    "softtxt13": "An open framework and platform for creating SPAs, written in TypeScript and supported and developed by Google. Angular was initially intended to be the second version of the AngularJS framework, but design decisions led Google to release it as a separate product, partly due to a lack of backward compatibility and a simple update path for applications written in AngularJS to Angular 2.",
    "softtxt14": "Laravel",
    "softtxt15": "PHP framework",
    "softtxt16": "A web application framework written in the PHP language based on the Model-View-Controller architectural pattern. Laravel provides, among other things, a modular system for building applications with a dedicated dependency manager, various ways to access relational databases, and tools to assist in application deployment and maintenance.",
